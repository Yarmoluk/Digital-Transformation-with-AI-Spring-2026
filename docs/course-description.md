# Digital Transformation 2.0 with Generative AI

**Title:** SEIS 666: Digital Transformation 2.0 with Generative AI - Revolutionizing Business with ChatGPT and GAI

**Target Audience:** Graduate students in software engineering, information systems, business analytics, and technology management

**Prerequisites:** No technical programming knowledge required. Students should have a high-level understanding of the Internet, web technologies, cloud services, and personal computer/mobile phone applications. Students must create free accounts with ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini before the course begins.

## Course Overview

Digital transformation has become a strategic imperative across every sector—from enterprise B2B operations and consumer experiences to government services and civic engagement. Yet the transformation journey has entered a fundamentally new phase. While foundational digital initiatives focused on cloud migration, automation, and data infrastructure, we are now witnessing an unprecedented acceleration driven by generative AI technologies that are reshaping how organizations create value, make decisions, and compete.

Research consistently shows that organizations achieving digital maturity outperform their peers—delivering products and services at twice the speed, reducing operational expenditures by 25-40%, and realizing significant gains in brand equity and customer satisfaction. However, fewer than one in four organizations successfully execute their digital transformation strategies. The differentiator? The ability to act with speed and intelligence, embedding AI-driven capabilities into the fabric of business operations.

Digital Transformation 2.0 represents the convergence of mature digital infrastructure with the transformative power of large language models (LLMs), multimodal AI, and autonomous agents. This graduate-level course examines this new paradigm, exploring how technologies like OpenAI's GPT models, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, and emerging platforms such as Perplexity AI and xAI's Grok are fundamentally altering business models, workforce dynamics, and competitive landscapes.
