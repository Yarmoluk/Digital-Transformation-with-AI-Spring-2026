## Self-Assessment Quiz

Test your understanding of Moore's Law and transistor growth.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 1: What does Moore's Law predict about transistor counts?**

1. Transistor counts remain constant over time
2. The number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years
3. Transistor counts decrease annually
4. Transistors will be replaced by vacuum tubes
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) The number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years - Gordon Moore's 1965 observation predicted exponential growth in transistor density, which has held roughly true for over 50 years.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 2: Why is viewing transistor growth on a logarithmic scale useful?**

1. It makes the data easier to fabricate
2. It shows exponential growth as a straight line, making trends easier to analyze
3. It is required by law
4. Logarithmic scales are more colorful
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) It shows exponential growth as a straight line, making trends easier to analyze - On a log scale, consistent doubling appears as a straight line, making it easy to see whether the exponential trend is continuing.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 3: How does Moore's Law relate to AI development?**

1. Moore's Law has no connection to AI
2. Increased computing power from Moore's Law enabled training larger and more capable AI models
3. Moore's Law only applies to consumer electronics
4. AI requires fewer transistors over time
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) Increased computing power from Moore's Law enabled training larger and more capable AI models - The exponential growth in available computing power has been essential for training increasingly large neural networks that power modern AI.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 4: What is a common concern about the future of Moore's Law?**

1. There will be too many transistors
2. Physical limitations at atomic scales may slow or end the exponential trend
3. No one understands transistors anymore
4. Transistors have become too cheap
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) Physical limitations at atomic scales may slow or end the exponential trend - As transistors approach atomic sizes, quantum effects and heat dissipation challenges create fundamental physical barriers to continued scaling.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 5: What time period does Moore's Law transistor growth data typically span?**

1. Only the last 5 years
2. From the early 1970s to present (approximately 50 years)
3. From 2020 to 2025 only
4. It covers projections 100 years into the future
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) From the early 1970s to present (approximately 50 years) - Moore's Law visualizations typically show data from the early microprocessor era (1970s) through today, demonstrating the remarkable consistency of the exponential trend over five decades.
