# The Accelerating Pace of AI

Use these templates to create a MicroSim that can
be added to any website with just a single ```iframe``` HTML element.

<iframe src="./main.html" width="620px" height="480px" scrolling="no"
  style="overflow: hidden;"></iframe>

You can include this MicroSim in your code by copying the following into your
website:

```html
<iframe src="/mains.html" width="600px" height="450px" scrolling="no"
  style="overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
```


[Run the AI Pace Accelerating MicroSim](./main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Self-Assessment Quiz

Test your understanding of the accelerating pace of AI development.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 1: What does the phrase "accelerating pace of AI" primarily refer to?**

1. AI systems are getting physically faster at moving objects
2. The rate of improvement in AI capabilities is itself increasing over time
3. AI companies are hiring more employees
4. AI is being deployed in more countries
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) The rate of improvement in AI capabilities is itself increasing over time - The accelerating pace refers to exponential rather than linear improvement, where each generation of AI advances more rapidly than the previous one.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 2: Why is it important for business leaders to understand AI acceleration trends?**

1. It helps them invest in AI company stocks
2. It helps them plan for capabilities that may become available sooner than expected
3. It is required by government regulations
4. It is only relevant to technology companies
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) It helps them plan for capabilities that may become available sooner than expected - Understanding acceleration trends helps organizations prepare strategies that account for rapidly evolving AI capabilities, avoiding being caught off-guard by technological change.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 3: What pattern does AI capability growth typically follow?**

1. Linear growth (same amount of improvement each year)
2. Exponential growth (improvement rate compounds over time)
3. No growth (capabilities remain constant)
4. Declining growth (improvements slow each year)
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) Exponential growth (improvement rate compounds over time) - AI capabilities have historically shown exponential growth patterns, with improvements building on previous advances to create compounding effects.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 4: What is a key implication of exponential AI improvement for organizations?**

1. They can safely ignore AI for the next decade
2. Planning horizons should account for capabilities arriving faster than intuition suggests
3. AI will never be relevant to their industry
4. Only large companies need to pay attention
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) Planning horizons should account for capabilities arriving faster than intuition suggests - Humans naturally think in linear terms, so exponential trends often surprise us. Organizations must account for capabilities that may seem far off but could arrive much sooner.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 5: What drives the accelerating pace of AI development?**

1. Only government funding
2. Feedback loops between data, algorithms, compute, and AI capabilities
3. A single breakthrough invention
4. Decreasing interest in AI research
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) Feedback loops between data, algorithms, compute, and AI capabilities - Multiple reinforcing factors including more training data, improved algorithms, better hardware, and AI systems that help create better AI systems create compounding improvement effects.
