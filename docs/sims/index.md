# Interactive Simulations (MicroSims)

MicroSims are small, focused interactive simulations built with p5.js and other JavaScript visualization libraries. They help students explore concepts through hands-on experimentation.

## What Are MicroSims?

MicroSims are:

- **Interactive**: Students control parameters and see results
- **Focused**: Each simulation addresses one concept
- **Accessible**: Run directly in the browser
- **Educational**: Designed for learning, not just demonstration

## Libraries Used

MicroSims in this textbook may use:

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| p5.js | General interactive graphics |
| Chart.js | Data visualization charts |
| vis-network | Network graph visualization |
| Mermaid | Diagrams and flowcharts |
| Plotly | Scientific plotting |

## Creating New MicroSims

New simulations can be created using the `microsim-generator` skill, which routes to the appropriate visualization library based on requirements.
