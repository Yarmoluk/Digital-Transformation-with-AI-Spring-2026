## About This MicroSim

This interactive tool allows you to assess organizational digital maturity using the classic 2x2 framework. Place organizations on the quadrant based on their Digital Intensity (technology adoption) and Transformation Management Intensity (governance and strategy).

## How to Use

1. **Click an Organization**: Select any organization dot to see its maturity profile
2. **Drag to Reposition**: Move organizations to different positions to see how recommendations change
3. **Add Organizations**: Click "+ Add Organization" to add your own company for assessment
4. **Analyze Patterns**: Observe how quadrant placement affects strategic recommendations

## The Four Digital Maturity Archetypes

| Quadrant | Digital Intensity | Transformation Mgmt | Characteristics |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Digirati** | High | High | Digital leaders with mature processes and governance |
| **Conservatives** | Low | High | Strong governance but cautious technology adoption |
| **Fashionistas** | High | Low | Technology-forward but lacking integration and process |
| **Beginners** | Low | Low | Starting the digital transformation journey |

## Key Dimensions

### Digital Intensity
Measures the extent to which an organization has adopted digital technologies:

- Use of cloud computing and modern infrastructure
- Digital customer engagement channels
- Data analytics and AI capabilities
- Automation of business processes
- Digital products and services

### Transformation Management Intensity
Measures how well an organization manages digital change:

- Executive vision and leadership
- Governance and investment frameworks
- IT-business collaboration
- Change management capabilities
- Digital skills and culture

## Learning Objectives

After using this tool, students should be able to:

- **Analyze** (Bloom's L4): Assess organizational characteristics and classify into maturity quadrants
- **Evaluate** (Bloom's L5): Judge an organization's digital maturity position
- **Apply** (Bloom's L3): Recommend improvement vectors for each archetype

## Lesson Plan

### Activity 1: Self-Assessment (15 minutes)
1. Add your current or target employer to the quadrant
2. Position it based on your assessment
3. Review the generated recommendations
4. Discuss whether you agree with the strategic guidance

### Activity 2: Transformation Journey (20 minutes)
1. Identify a "Beginner" organization
2. Map out the transformation path to "Digirati"
3. What investments in technology vs. governance are needed?
4. What are the risks of becoming a "Fashionista" along the way?

### Discussion Questions

1. Can an organization be successful as a "Conservative"? When might this be appropriate?
2. What are the dangers of the "Fashionista" quadrant?
3. How do industry dynamics affect optimal quadrant positioning?

## Strategic Recommendations by Quadrant

| Starting Position | Primary Focus | Key Actions |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Beginners** | Build foundation | Digital literacy, pilot projects, governance basics |
| **Fashionistas** | Integrate & govern | Strategic alignment, process maturity, ROI measurement |
| **Conservatives** | Accelerate adoption | Technology investments, innovation labs, digital culture |
| **Digirati** | Innovate & lead | Emerging tech exploration, ecosystem leadership |

## Self-Assessment Quiz

Test your understanding of the Digital Maturity Quadrant Model.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 1: What are the two dimensions used to classify organizations in the Digital Maturity model?**

1. Revenue and Profit
2. Digital Intensity and Transformation Management Intensity
3. Technology and Marketing
4. Size and Industry
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) Digital Intensity and Transformation Management Intensity - Organizations are evaluated on their technology adoption (Digital Intensity) and their ability to manage digital change (Transformation Management Intensity).

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 2: Which quadrant represents "Digirati" organizations?**

1. Low Digital Intensity, Low Transformation Management
2. Low Digital Intensity, High Transformation Management
3. High Digital Intensity, Low Transformation Management
4. High Digital Intensity, High Transformation Management
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    D) High Digital Intensity, High Transformation Management - Digirati are digital leaders who combine strong technology adoption with mature governance and management processes.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 3: What is the primary risk for organizations in the "Fashionista" quadrant?**

1. They are too slow to adopt technology
2. They adopt technology without proper integration and governance
3. They have no digital capabilities
4. They focus too much on governance
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) They adopt technology without proper integration and governance - Fashionistas are technology-forward but lack the management intensity to effectively integrate and govern their digital investments.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 4: What strategic recommendation is appropriate for "Conservative" organizations?**

1. Reduce technology investment
2. Eliminate all governance processes
3. Accelerate technology adoption while leveraging existing strong governance
4. Stay in the current quadrant permanently
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    C) Accelerate technology adoption while leveraging existing strong governance - Conservatives have strong management processes but cautious technology adoption, so they should use their governance strength to enable faster, well-managed digital investments.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 5: Why might an organization choose to remain in the "Conservative" quadrant?**

1. They want to fail
2. Regulatory constraints or their competitive advantage comes from non-technology factors
3. They have unlimited resources
4. They don't understand technology
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) Regulatory constraints or their competitive advantage comes from non-technology factors - Some industries with strict regulations or organizations whose value comes from factors other than technology may appropriately maintain a conservative digital posture.
