# Deep Learning Timeline MicroSim

Here is a timeline that includes over 100 key events in the field of Deep Learning.
The events span from 1935 to present, although events in the last two
years had to be entered by hand since ChatGPT o1 is [Frozen in Time](../../glossary.md#frozen-in-time)

## Self-Assessment Quiz

Test your understanding of deep learning history and key milestones.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 1: Approximately what time span does the Deep Learning Timeline cover?**

1. Only 2020-2025
2. From 1935 to present (approximately 90 years)
3. From 2000 to 2010
4. Only the last 5 years
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) From 1935 to present (approximately 90 years) - The timeline captures the full history of ideas leading to modern deep learning, from early theoretical foundations to recent breakthroughs.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 2: Why is understanding the history of AI important for AI strategy?**

1. It is not important at all
2. It provides context for current capabilities and helps anticipate future developments
3. History is required by law
4. It only matters for academic researchers
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) It provides context for current capabilities and helps anticipate future developments - Understanding how AI evolved helps strategists recognize patterns, avoid past mistakes, and better predict where the technology is heading.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 3: What does the term "Frozen in Time" refer to in the context of AI models?**

1. AI that operates in cold temperatures
2. AI models have a knowledge cutoff date and don't know about events after their training
3. AI that cannot be updated
4. AI stored in ice cubes
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) AI models have a knowledge cutoff date and don't know about events after their training - Language models are trained on data up to a certain point and lack awareness of events that occurred after their training cutoff.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 4: How many key events does the timeline include?**

1. About 10 events
2. Over 100 key events
3. Exactly 25 events
4. Only 5 events
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) Over 100 key events - The timeline includes over 100 significant milestones in deep learning history, from theoretical breakthroughs to practical applications.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
**Question 5: Why have recent events in the timeline been entered manually rather than generated by AI?**

1. AI cannot type
2. AI models have knowledge cutoffs and cannot access information about events after their training
3. Manual entry is always preferred
4. Recent events are not important
</div>

??? success "Answer"
    B) AI models have knowledge cutoffs and cannot access information about events after their training - Events from the most recent years must be added manually because the AI models used to help create content don't have access to information beyond their training data cutoff.
