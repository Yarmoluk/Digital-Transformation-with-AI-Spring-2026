## About This MicroSim

This interactive assessment tool helps students evaluate AI strategy documents against ten key dimensions. A radar chart provides visual feedback on completeness and quality, while the tool offers specific improvement suggestions for weak areas. This is particularly useful for self-assessment before submitting the capstone project.

### Iframe Embedding

You can include this MicroSim on your website using the following `iframe`:

```html
<iframe src="https://dmccreary.github.io/Digital-Transformation-with-AI-Spring-2026/sims/ai-strategy-assessment/main.html"
        height="602px"
        width="100%"
        scrolling="no">
</iframe>
```

## How to Use

1. **Mark Present Sections**: Use checkboxes to indicate which strategy components are included
2. **Rate Quality**: Use sliders (1-5) to rate the quality of each present section
3. **Review Radar Chart**: Observe how your strategy's shape compares to an ideal (full) radar
4. **Check Suggestions**: Review improvement recommendations for weak areas
5. **Iterate**: Use the feedback to strengthen your strategy document

## Ten Strategy Dimensions

| Dimension | What to Include | Quality Indicators |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Executive Summary** | Strategic rationale, key outcomes, resource summary | Clear, concise, compelling |
| **Current State** | AI maturity, existing capabilities, competitive landscape | Data-driven, honest assessment |
| **Vision/Objectives** | Long-term vision, measurable goals, strategic alignment | Specific, ambitious yet achievable |
| **Use Case Portfolio** | Prioritized initiatives, quick wins, dependencies | Comprehensive, well-prioritized |
| **Technology Strategy** | Platform approach, data strategy, vendor plan | Coherent, scalable |
| **Organization Plan** | Operating model, skills, training | Realistic, well-resourced |
| **Governance Framework** | Ethics guidelines, accountability, risk management | Comprehensive, practical |
| **Implementation Roadmap** | Phases, milestones, resources | Detailed, achievable |
| **Investment Case** | ROI projections, funding needs, business case | Compelling, well-supported |
| **Risk Assessment** | Key risks, mitigation strategies, contingencies | Thorough, actionable |

## Quality Scoring Guide

| Score | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **5** | Excellent | Comprehensive, well-supported with evidence, actionable |
| **4** | Good | Complete, clear, minor gaps or improvements possible |
| **3** | Adequate | Present but lacks depth or specificity |
| **2** | Weak | Incomplete, vague, or missing key elements |
| **1** | Missing/Poor | Absent or fundamentally flawed |

## Overall Assessment Ratings

- **80%+**: Excellent - Ready for Implementation
- **60-79%**: Good - Minor Improvements Needed
- **40-59%**: Adequate - Several Gaps to Address
- **Below 40%**: Needs Work - Major Revision Required

## Learning Objectives

After using this tool, students should be able to:

- **Evaluate** (Bloom's L5): Evaluate strategy documents against quality criteria
- **Analyze** (Bloom's L4): Analyze gaps and weaknesses in AI strategies
- **Create** (Bloom's L6): Create improvement plans for identified gaps

## Lesson Plan

### Activity 1: Self-Assessment (15 minutes)
Assess your own capstone project draft using the tool:
1. Honestly rate each section's presence and quality
2. Note your overall score
3. Identify the top 3 areas needing improvement

### Activity 2: Peer Review (20 minutes)
Exchange strategy documents with a classmate and assess each other's work:
1. Use the tool to score your peer's strategy
2. Compare your assessment with their self-assessment
3. Discuss discrepancies and insights

### Activity 3: Gap Analysis (10 minutes)
For your lowest-scoring dimensions:
1. Review the specific suggestions provided
2. Create an action plan for each improvement
3. Estimate effort required for each improvement

### Discussion Questions
1. Which dimensions are most commonly weak in AI strategies? Why?
2. How do the ten dimensions relate to each other? What dependencies exist?
3. What's the minimum acceptable score for a production-ready AI strategy?

## Example Assessments

**Weak Strategy Example**: Click "Weak Example" to see a typical incomplete strategy with missing sections and low quality scores.

**Strong Strategy Example**: Click "Strong Example" to see a comprehensive strategy with all sections present at high quality.
