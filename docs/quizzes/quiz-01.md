## Questions

### Question 1 (Remember)
**Which term describes the conversion of analog information into digital format?**

- [ ] A) Digital transformation
- [ ] B) Digitalization
- [x] C) Digitization
- [ ] D) Digital maturity

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Digitization** - Digitization is specifically the conversion of analog to digital format. Digital transformation is the broader integration of technology into business operations. Digitalization uses digital technologies to change business models.

### Question 2 (Remember)
**What percentage of organizations successfully execute their digital transformation strategies, according to research?**

- [ ] A) More than 75%
- [ ] B) About 50%
- [x] C) Fewer than 25%
- [ ] D) About 90%

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Fewer than 25%** - Research consistently shows that fewer than one in four organizations successfully execute their digital transformation strategies, highlighting the difficulty of transformation initiatives.

### Question 3 (Understand)
**What is the relationship between digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation?**

- [ ] A) They are interchangeable terms
- [ ] B) Digital transformation comes before digitization
- [x] C) They represent a progression from basic to strategic change
- [ ] D) Digitalization is the broadest term

??? success "Answer"
    **C) They represent a progression from basic to strategic change** - Digitization (converting to digital) → Digitalization (using digital to change processes) → Digital transformation (fundamental business reinvention through technology).

### Question 4 (Understand)
**What distinguishes Digital Transformation 2.0 from earlier digital transformation initiatives?**

- [ ] A) Focus on cloud migration
- [ ] B) Emphasis on data infrastructure
- [x] C) Integration of generative AI capabilities
- [ ] D) Adoption of mobile technologies

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Integration of generative AI capabilities** - Digital Transformation 2.0 represents the convergence of mature digital infrastructure with generative AI technologies like LLMs and multimodal AI.

---

### Question 5 (Apply)
**An organization wants to assess its readiness for AI adoption. Which framework would be most appropriate?**

- [ ] A) Prompt engineering guidelines
- [x] B) Digital capability model
- [ ] C) API documentation
- [ ] D) Token counting methodology

??? success "Answer"
    **B) Digital capability model** - Digital capability models and maturity assessments help organizations evaluate their readiness for AI adoption by examining their current digital competencies.

---

### Question 6 (Apply)
**A company achieved digital maturity and now delivers products twice as fast. This benefit is best described as:**

- [ ] A) Cost optimization
- [x] B) Competitive advantage
- [ ] C) Digitization
- [ ] D) AI governance

??? success "Answer"
    **B) Competitive advantage** - Delivering products faster than competitors represents a competitive advantage gained through digital transformation.

---

### Question 7 (Analyze)
**Compare the primary focus of machine learning versus generative AI:**

- [ ] A) Both focus on generating new content
- [ ] B) Both focus on classification tasks
- [x] C) ML focuses on patterns/predictions; Gen AI focuses on content creation
- [ ] D) Gen AI is a prerequisite for ML

??? success "Answer"
    **C) ML focuses on patterns/predictions; Gen AI focuses on content creation** - Machine learning identifies patterns to make predictions, while generative AI creates new content (text, images, etc.) based on learned patterns.

---

### Question 8 (Analyze)
**Which factor most differentiates successful digital transformation initiatives from unsuccessful ones?**

- [ ] A) Budget size
- [ ] B) Technology choices
- [x] C) Embedding AI-driven capabilities into operations
- [ ] D) Number of employees trained

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Embedding AI-driven capabilities into operations** - Research shows the key differentiator is the ability to embed AI-driven capabilities into the fabric of business operations, not just technology adoption.

---

### Question 9 (Evaluate)
**An organization is debating whether to pursue incremental digital improvements or a full AI transformation. Which approach is most appropriate for an organization with low digital maturity?**

- [x] A) Start with foundational digitalization before AI
- [ ] B) Jump directly to advanced AI implementation
- [ ] C) Avoid AI entirely
- [ ] D) Outsource all technology decisions

??? success "Answer"
    **A) Start with foundational digitalization before AI** - Organizations need digital foundations (data infrastructure, digital processes) before successfully implementing advanced AI. Jumping to AI without foundations often leads to failure.

---

### Question 10 (Create)
**You are designing a digital transformation roadmap for a traditional manufacturing company. Which sequence represents the best approach?**

- [ ] A) Deploy AI chatbots → Assess maturity → Train employees
- [ ] B) Train employees → Deploy AI → Assess results
- [x] C) Assess maturity → Identify use cases → Build capabilities → Scale AI
- [ ] D) Scale AI → Identify use cases → Assess maturity

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Assess maturity → Identify use cases → Build capabilities → Scale AI** - Successful transformation starts with understanding current state, identifying valuable applications, building necessary capabilities, then scaling proven solutions.
