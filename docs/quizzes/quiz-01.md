## Questions

### Question 1 (Remember)
**Which term describes the conversion of analog information into digital format?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Digital transformation
1. Digitalization
1. Digitization
1. Digital maturity
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Digitization** - Digitization is specifically the conversion of analog to digital format. Digital transformation is the broader integration of technology into business operations. Digitalization uses digital technologies to change business models.

---

### Question 2 (Remember)
**What percentage of organizations successfully execute their digital transformation strategies, according to research?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. More than 75%
1. About 50%
1. Fewer than 25%
1. About 90%
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Fewer than 25%** - Research consistently shows that fewer than one in four organizations successfully execute their digital transformation strategies, highlighting the difficulty of transformation initiatives.

---

### Question 3 (Understand)
**What is the relationship between digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are interchangeable terms
1. Digital transformation comes before digitization
1. They represent a progression from basic to strategic change
1. Digitalization is the broadest term
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) They represent a progression from basic to strategic change** - Digitization (converting to digital) → Digitalization (using digital to change processes) → Digital transformation (fundamental business reinvention through technology).

---

### Question 4 (Understand)
**What distinguishes Digital Transformation 2.0 from earlier digital transformation initiatives?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Focus on cloud migration
1. Emphasis on data infrastructure
1. Integration of generative AI capabilities
1. Adoption of mobile technologies
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Integration of generative AI capabilities** - Digital Transformation 2.0 represents the convergence of mature digital infrastructure with generative AI technologies like LLMs and multimodal AI.

---

### Question 5 (Apply)
**An organization wants to assess its readiness for AI adoption. Which framework would be most appropriate?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Prompt engineering guidelines
1. Digital capability model
1. API documentation
1. Token counting methodology
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **B) Digital capability model** - Digital capability models and maturity assessments help organizations evaluate their readiness for AI adoption by examining their current digital competencies.

---

### Question 6 (Apply)
**A company achieved digital maturity and now delivers products twice as fast. This benefit is best described as:**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Cost optimization
1. Competitive advantage
1. Digitization
1. AI governance
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **B) Competitive advantage** - Delivering products faster than competitors represents a competitive advantage gained through digital transformation.

---

### Question 7 (Analyze)
**Compare the primary focus of machine learning versus generative AI:**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Both focus on generating new content
1. Both focus on classification tasks
1. ML focuses on patterns/predictions; Gen AI focuses on content creation
1. Gen AI is a prerequisite for ML
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) ML focuses on patterns/predictions; Gen AI focuses on content creation** - Machine learning identifies patterns to make predictions, while generative AI creates new content (text, images, etc.) based on learned patterns.

---

### Question 8 (Analyze)
**Which factor most differentiates successful digital transformation initiatives from unsuccessful ones?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Budget size
1. Technology choices
1. Embedding AI-driven capabilities into operations
1. Number of employees trained
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Embedding AI-driven capabilities into operations** - Research shows the key differentiator is the ability to embed AI-driven capabilities into the fabric of business operations, not just technology adoption.

---

### Question 9 (Evaluate)
**An organization is debating whether to pursue incremental digital improvements or a full AI transformation. Which approach is most appropriate for an organization with low digital maturity?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Start with foundational digitalization before AI
1. Jump directly to advanced AI implementation
1. Avoid AI entirely
1. Outsource all technology decisions
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **A) Start with foundational digitalization before AI** - Organizations need digital foundations (data infrastructure, digital processes) before successfully implementing advanced AI. Jumping to AI without foundations often leads to failure.

---

### Question 10 (Create)
**You are designing a digital transformation roadmap for a traditional manufacturing company. Which sequence represents the best approach?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Deploy AI chatbots → Assess maturity → Train employees
1. Train employees → Deploy AI → Assess results
1. Assess maturity → Identify use cases → Build capabilities → Scale AI
1. Scale AI → Identify use cases → Assess maturity
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Assess maturity → Identify use cases → Build capabilities → Scale AI** - Successful transformation starts with understanding current state, identifying valuable applications, building necessary capabilities, then scaling proven solutions.

---

## Score Interpretation

- **9-10 correct**: Excellent understanding of foundations
- **7-8 correct**: Good grasp, review missed concepts
- **5-6 correct**: Fair understanding, revisit chapter sections
- **Below 5**: Re-read Chapter 1 before proceeding
