## Questions

### Question 1 (Remember)
**What is a diffusion model?**

- [ ] A) A model that spreads information across networks
- [x] B) A generative model that creates images by iteratively removing noise
- [ ] C) A text-only language model
- [ ] D) A compression algorithm

??? success "Answer"
    **B) A generative model that creates images by iteratively removing noise** - Diffusion models start with random noise and progressively denoise it based on text prompts to generate coherent images.

---

### Question 2 (Remember)
**Which platform is known for generating artistic, creative images?**

- [ ] A) ChatGPT
- [ ] B) Claude
- [x] C) Midjourney
- [ ] D) Perplexity

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Midjourney** - Midjourney is particularly known for generating artistic, aesthetically pleasing images with a distinctive style, popular among designers and artists.

---

### Question 3 (Understand)
**What enables GPT-4 Vision to analyze images?**

- [ ] A) Separate image processing software
- [x] B) Native multimodal capabilities in the model architecture
- [ ] C) External plugins only
- [ ] D) Manual image description

??? success "Answer"
    **B) Native multimodal capabilities in the model architecture** - GPT-4V has built-in ability to process visual inputs alongside text, understanding images directly without external tools.

---

### Question 4 (Understand)
**Why is text-to-video generation more challenging than text-to-image?**

- [ ] A) Video uses fewer parameters
- [x] B) Video requires temporal consistency across many frames
- [ ] C) Video technology is older
- [ ] D) There is no difference in difficulty

??? success "Answer"
    **B) Video requires temporal consistency across many frames** - Video generation must maintain coherence across time (objects moving consistently, physics, continuity), making it significantly more complex than single images.

---

### Question 5 (Apply)
**You need to extract text from handwritten documents. Which AI capability would you use?**

- [ ] A) Text-to-image
- [ ] B) Speech-to-text
- [x] C) Vision/image analysis with OCR
- [ ] D) Text-to-speech

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Vision/image analysis with OCR** - Vision capabilities in multimodal models can analyze images including handwritten text, extracting and transcribing content (OCR functionality).

---

### Question 6 (Apply)
**A marketing team needs product images for an e-commerce site but has no photography budget. What's the best approach?**

- [ ] A) Use stock photos only
- [x] B) Generate product images using text-to-image AI like DALL-E
- [ ] C) Skip images entirely
- [ ] D) Use text descriptions only

??? success "Answer"
    **B) Generate product images using text-to-image AI like DALL-E** - AI image generation can create product visuals from descriptions, though quality and accuracy should be verified for commercial use.

---

### Question 7 (Analyze)
**Compare DALL-E and Stable Diffusion in terms of accessibility and control:**

- [ ] A) They are identical
- [ ] B) DALL-E is open-source
- [x] C) DALL-E is API-based; Stable Diffusion is open-source with more customization
- [ ] D) Stable Diffusion requires no technical knowledge

??? success "Answer"
    **C) DALL-E is API-based; Stable Diffusion is open-source with more customization** - DALL-E is accessed through OpenAI's API, while Stable Diffusion is open-source, allowing local deployment and extensive customization.

---

### Question 8 (Analyze)
**What are the primary business applications for speech-to-text AI?**

- [ ] A) Image generation
- [x] B) Meeting transcription, customer call analysis, accessibility
- [ ] C) Video editing
- [ ] D) Code generation

??? success "Answer"
    **B) Meeting transcription, customer call analysis, accessibility** - Speech-to-text enables automatic transcription of meetings, analysis of customer calls at scale, and accessibility features for hearing-impaired users.

---

### Question 9 (Evaluate)
**An organization wants to use AI-generated images for advertising. What's the most important consideration?**

- [ ] A) Generation speed
- [ ] B) Image resolution only
- [x] C) Copyright, authenticity, and brand safety implications
- [ ] D) Cost per image

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Copyright, authenticity, and brand safety implications** - Commercial use of AI images raises questions about copyright, potential for misleading content, and brand reputation risks that must be carefully evaluated.

---

### Question 10 (Create)
**Design a multimodal AI solution for a real estate company that needs: property descriptions, virtual staging, and voice-enabled search.**

- [ ] A) Text-only chatbot
- [ ] B) Image generation only
- [x] C) Integrated solution: text generation for descriptions, image AI for staging, speech-to-text for search
- [ ] D) Manual processes only

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Integrated solution: text generation for descriptions, image AI for staging, speech-to-text for search** - Each modality serves a purpose: LLMs for compelling descriptions, image AI for virtual staging, speech recognition for hands-free search.

---
