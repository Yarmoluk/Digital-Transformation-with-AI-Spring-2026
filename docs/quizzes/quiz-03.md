<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Available in multiple languages
1. Can be accessed through multiple interfaces
1. Can process multiple types of data (text, images, audio)
1. Uses multiple neural networks
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Can process multiple types of data (text, images, audio)** - Multimodal models can handle different input types within a single system, such as analyzing images while generating text responses.

---

### Question 4 (Understand)
**Why might an organization choose Claude over ChatGPT for document analysis?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Claude is always cheaper
1. Claude has more plugins
1. Claude has a larger context window for long documents
1. Claude has image generation
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Claude has a larger context window for long documents** - Claude 3 offers up to 200K tokens context window, making it well-suited for analyzing long documents without chunking.

---

### Question 5 (Apply)
**A startup needs to build an AI product but has limited budget. Which platform approach is most appropriate?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Enterprise ChatGPT license
1. Open-source models like Llama for self-hosting
1. Multiple proprietary model subscriptions
1. Custom model training from scratch
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **B) Open-source models like Llama for self-hosting** - Open-source models have no licensing costs and can be self-hosted, making them ideal for budget-conscious organizations willing to manage infrastructure.

---

### Question 6 (Apply)
**You need to generate marketing images from text descriptions. Which platform would you use?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Claude 3 Opus
1. Perplexity AI
1. DALL-E or Midjourney
1. Mistral AI
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) DALL-E or Midjourney** - DALL-E (OpenAI) and Midjourney are specialized text-to-image generation platforms. Claude and Perplexity focus on text, and Mistral focuses on language models.

---

### Question 7 (Analyze)
**Compare proprietary models (GPT-4, Claude) with open-source models (Llama, Mistral) in terms of control and capability:**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Proprietary always offers more control
1. Open-source always matches proprietary in capability
1. Proprietary offers better capability; open-source offers more control
1. There are no meaningful differences
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Proprietary offers better capability; open-source offers more control** - Proprietary models generally lead in capability, while open-source models offer more control over deployment, customization, and data privacy.

---

### Question 8 (Analyze)
**What is the strategic significance of the Mixtral architecture from Mistral AI?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It's the largest model available
1. Mixture-of-experts enables efficient inference at scale
1. It only works on specialized hardware
1. It requires no training
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **B) Mixture-of-experts enables efficient inference at scale** - Mixtral uses a mixture-of-experts architecture that activates only relevant model components for each query, providing strong performance with efficient resource usage.

---

### Question 9 (Evaluate)
**A healthcare organization needs AI for patient data analysis. Which platform consideration is most critical?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Cost per token
1. Creative writing capabilities
1. Data privacy and compliance capabilities
1. Image generation quality
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Data privacy and compliance capabilities** - Healthcare involves sensitive patient data subject to regulations like HIPAA. Privacy, security, and compliance are paramount considerations before capability or cost.

---

### Question 10 (Create)
**Design a multi-model strategy for an enterprise that needs: (1) customer support chat, (2) long document analysis, (3) image creation, and (4) cost efficiency.**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Use GPT-4 for everything
1. Use open-source for everything
1. ChatGPT for support, Claude for documents, DALL-E for images, open-source for high-volume/low-complexity
1. Avoid AI until one model does everything
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) ChatGPT for support, Claude for documents, DALL-E for images, open-source for high-volume/low-complexity** - A multi-model strategy matches platform strengths to use cases, optimizing for capability and cost across different requirements.
