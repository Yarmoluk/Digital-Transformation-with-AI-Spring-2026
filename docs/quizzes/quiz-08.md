**What is the purpose of red-teaming in AI systems?**

- [ ] A) To make AI faster
- [x] B) To find vulnerabilities and failure modes through adversarial testing
- [ ] C) To train new models
- [ ] D) To reduce costs

??? success "Answer"
    **B) To find vulnerabilities and failure modes through adversarial testing** - Red teams deliberately try to "break" AI systems to identify weaknesses, biases, and safety issues before deployment.

### Question 4 (Understand)
**Why is AI transparency important?**

- [ ] A) It makes AI faster
- [ ] B) It reduces development costs
- [x] C) It enables understanding of AI decisions and builds trust
- [ ] D) It is only relevant for open-source models

??? success "Answer"
    **C) It enables understanding of AI decisions and builds trust** - Transparency helps users and stakeholders understand how AI systems work, their limitations, and the basis for their outputs.

### Question 5 (Apply)
**Your organization is implementing AI for hiring decisions. What governance measure is most critical?**

- [ ] A) Faster processing
- [ ] B) Cost reduction
- [x] C) Bias detection and mitigation with human oversight
- [ ] D) Automated decision-making without review

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Bias detection and mitigation with human oversight** - High-stakes decisions like hiring require careful attention to fairness, with systems to detect bias, mitigation strategies, and human review of AI recommendations.

- [ ] C) Principles are more restrictive
- [ ] D) Rules are never used

??? success "Answer"
    **B) Rules are specific and prescriptive; principles provide flexible guidance** - Rules define specific requirements (do X, don't do Y), while principles establish values and goals that guide decisions across varied situations.

---

### Question 8 (Analyze)
**What is the relationship between AI hallucinations and responsible AI deployment?**

- [ ] A) Hallucinations are desirable
- [ ] B) They are unrelated
- [x] C) Managing hallucination risk is a key responsible AI requirement
- [ ] D) Hallucinations only affect images

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Managing hallucination risk is a key responsible AI requirement** - Responsible AI requires acknowledging that models can generate incorrect information and implementing safeguards (grounding, verification, disclaimers).

---

### Question 9 (Evaluate)
**An AI system shows higher error rates for certain demographic groups. How should this be addressed?**

- [ ] A) Ignore it if overall accuracy is good
- [ ] B) Remove the demographic data
- [x] C) Investigate root causes, implement bias mitigation, and monitor continuously
- [ ] D) Deploy anyway and fix later

??? success "Answer"
    **C) Investigate root causes, implement bias mitigation, and monitor continuously** - Disparate performance requires understanding why it occurs, taking corrective action, and ongoing monitoring to ensure the issue is resolved.

---

### Question 10 (Create)
