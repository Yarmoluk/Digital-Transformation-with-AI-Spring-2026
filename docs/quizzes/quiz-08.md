<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. An AI model
1. An organizational unit for developing and scaling AI capabilities
1. A regulatory body
1. A type of API
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **B) An organizational unit for developing and scaling AI capabilities** - A GAICoE provides governance, best practices, training, and support for AI initiatives across the organization.

---

### Question 2 (Remember)
**What is the EU AI Act?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A US regulation
1. An AI model
1. European legislation establishing rules for AI development and use
1. A private industry standard
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) European legislation establishing rules for AI development and use** - The EU AI Act is a risk-based regulatory framework governing AI systems in the European Union.

---

### Question 3 (Understand)
**What is the purpose of red-teaming in AI systems?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To make AI faster
1. To find vulnerabilities and failure modes through adversarial testing
1. To train new models
1. To reduce costs
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **B) To find vulnerabilities and failure modes through adversarial testing** - Red teams deliberately try to "break" AI systems to identify weaknesses, biases, and safety issues before deployment.

---

### Question 4 (Understand)
**Why is AI transparency important?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It makes AI faster
1. It reduces development costs
1. It enables understanding of AI decisions and builds trust
1. It is only relevant for open-source models
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) It enables understanding of AI decisions and builds trust** - Transparency helps users and stakeholders understand how AI systems work, their limitations, and the basis for their outputs.

---

### Question 5 (Apply)
**Your organization is implementing AI for hiring decisions. What governance measure is most critical?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Faster processing
1. Cost reduction
1. Bias detection and mitigation with human oversight
1. Automated decision-making without review
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Bias detection and mitigation with human oversight** - High-stakes decisions like hiring require careful attention to fairness, with systems to detect bias, mitigation strategies, and human review of AI recommendations.

---

### Question 6 (Apply)
**A customer asks how your AI chatbot made a recommendation. What principle are they invoking?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Efficiency
1. Explainability
1. Speed
1. Creativity
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **B) Explainability** - Explainability is the ability to describe AI decision-making in understandable terms. Users have a reasonable expectation to understand significant AI-driven recommendations.

---

### Question 7 (Analyze)
**Compare rule-based AI governance with principles-based governance:**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are identical
1. Rules are specific and prescriptive; principles provide flexible guidance
1. Principles are more restrictive
1. Rules are never used
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **B) Rules are specific and prescriptive; principles provide flexible guidance** - Rules define specific requirements (do X, don't do Y), while principles establish values and goals that guide decisions across varied situations.

---

### Question 8 (Analyze)
**What is the relationship between AI hallucinations and responsible AI deployment?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Hallucinations are desirable
1. They are unrelated
1. Managing hallucination risk is a key responsible AI requirement
1. Hallucinations only affect images
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Managing hallucination risk is a key responsible AI requirement** - Responsible AI requires acknowledging that models can generate incorrect information and implementing safeguards (grounding, verification, disclaimers).

---

### Question 9 (Evaluate)
**An AI system shows higher error rates for certain demographic groups. How should this be addressed?**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Ignore it if overall accuracy is good
1. Remove the demographic data
1. Investigate root causes, implement bias mitigation, and monitor continuously
1. Deploy anyway and fix later
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Investigate root causes, implement bias mitigation, and monitor continuously** - Disparate performance requires understanding why it occurs, taking corrective action, and ongoing monitoring to ensure the issue is resolved.

---

### Question 10 (Create)
**Design a GAICoE charter for a healthcare organization with strict regulatory requirements and diverse AI use cases.**

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Copy a generic template
1. Focus only on technology
1. Include: mission, scope, governance structure, compliance framework, ethics review, stakeholder engagement, success metrics
1. Wait for regulations to be finalized
</div>


??? success "Answer"
    **C) Include: mission, scope, governance structure, compliance framework, ethics review, stakeholder engagement, success metrics** - Healthcare GAICoE needs comprehensive governance addressing the unique regulatory (HIPAA), ethical (patient safety), and organizational requirements.
