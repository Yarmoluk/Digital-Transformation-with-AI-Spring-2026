# Tracking AI Progress and Trends

Understanding the trajectory of AI development is critical for strategic planning. This chapter explores how we measure AI progress, examine key benchmarks, and project future capabilities based on observed trends. Through interactive visualizations, you'll develop intuition for the exponential nature of AI advancement and its implications for digital transformation.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

## Measuring AI Capabilities

### The METR Benchmark Approach

METR (Model Evaluation & Threat Research) has pioneered a practical approach to measuring AI capabilities: **task horizon**—the length of tasks (measured by how long they take human professionals) that AI can complete autonomously with a given reliability threshold.

This metric matters because:

- It translates abstract AI capabilities into concrete, understandable terms
- It directly relates to business process automation potential
- It provides a consistent measure across different AI models and generations

### AI Task Horizons

The following visualization shows how different AI models perform across tasks of varying duration, demonstrating how capability has evolved over time.

**Key Insights:**

- Early models could only handle tasks lasting seconds to minutes
- Current frontier models can complete multi-hour tasks autonomously
- The progression shows consistent exponential improvement

## The Seven-Month Doubling Rate

Perhaps the most striking finding from METR's research is that AI task completion capabilities have been **doubling approximately every seven months**. This is one of the fastest capability growth rates observed in any technology domain.

<iframe src="../../sims/ai-doubling-rate/main.html" width="100%" height="520" scrolling="no" style="border: none;"></iframe>

[View AI Doubling Rate Fullscreen](../../sims/ai-doubling-rate/main.html){ .md-button }

### What the Doubling Rate Means

| Current Capability | Time | Projected Capability |
|-------------------|------|---------------------|
| 5 hours | +7 months | 10 hours |
| 5 hours | +14 months | 20 hours |
| 5 hours | +21 months | 40 hours (1 week) |
| 5 hours | +28 months | 80 hours (2 weeks) |

If this trend continues, AI systems may handle tasks lasting weeks or months within the next few years.

[View AI Pace Accelerating Fullscreen](../../sims/ai-pace-accelerating/main.html){ .md-button }

**Drivers of Acceleration:**

1. **More Training Data**: Larger, higher-quality datasets
2. **Better Algorithms**: Transformer architecture improvements, new training techniques
3. **More Compute**: Exponentially increasing training compute budgets
4. **Feedback Loops**: AI helping to develop better AI

## Historical Context: Computing Foundations

To understand AI's trajectory, we must understand the computing foundations that enable it.

### Moore's Law

Moore's Law—the observation that transistor counts double approximately every two years—has been the foundation of computing progress for over 50 years.

<iframe src="../../sims/moores-law/main.html" height="600px" width="100%" scrolling="no" style="border: none;"></iframe>

[View Moore's Law Fullscreen](../../sims/moores-law/main.html){ .md-button }

**Key Observations:**

- Exponential transistor growth has continued for 50+ years
- This growth has enabled increasingly powerful AI systems
- Physical limits may eventually slow this trend

### The Power Wall

While transistor counts continued growing, clock speeds hit a wall around 2004 due to thermal constraints. This shifted the industry toward parallel processing—which coincidentally aligned perfectly with AI workloads.

**Strategic Implications:**

- The shift to parallel processing enabled GPU-based AI training
- Modern AI hardware (GPUs, TPUs) is optimized for parallel workloads
- This architectural shift was crucial for deep learning's success

[View Projecting AI Fullscreen](../../sims/projecting-ai/main.html){ .md-button }

### Five-Year Projection (If 7-Month Doubling Continues)

| Date | Projected Task Horizon |
|------|----------------------|
| Late 2025 | ~5 hours |
| Mid 2026 | ~10 hours |
| Early 2027 | ~20 hours |
| Late 2027 | ~40 hours (1 work week) |
| Mid 2028 | ~80 hours (2 weeks) |
| Early 2029 | ~160 hours (1 month) |
| Late 2029 | ~320 hours (2 months) |
| Mid 2030 | ~640 hours (4 months) |

### Important Caveats

!!! warning "Projections Are Not Predictions"
    These projections assume current trends continue. Several factors could alter this trajectory:

    - **Physical limits**: Training compute, data availability, energy constraints
    - **Algorithmic plateaus**: Diminishing returns from current approaches
    - **Economic factors**: Investment cycles, cost constraints
    - **Regulatory changes**: Government intervention, safety requirements
    - **Fundamental barriers**: Tasks requiring real-world interaction, long-term planning
