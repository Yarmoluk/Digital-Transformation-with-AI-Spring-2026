## Welcome

Welcome to this intelligent textbook for **SEIS 666: Digital Transformation 2.0 with Generative AI**. This course examines how generative AI technologies—including large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and emerging platforms—are fundamentally reshaping business models, workforce dynamics, and competitive landscapes.

## Why This Course Matters

Digital transformation has entered a fundamentally new phase. While foundational digital initiatives focused on cloud migration, automation, and data infrastructure, we are now witnessing an unprecedented acceleration driven by generative AI technologies.

Research consistently shows that organizations achieving digital maturity:

- Deliver products and services at **twice the speed**
- Reduce operational expenditures by **25-40%**
- Realize significant gains in brand equity and customer satisfaction

However, fewer than one in four organizations successfully execute their digital transformation strategies. The differentiator? The ability to act with speed and intelligence, embedding AI-driven capabilities into the fabric of business operations.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Apply** generative AI platforms to solve business problems
- **Assess** organizational digital maturity and readiness for AI adoption
- **Design** AI governance frameworks and Centers of Excellence
- **Evaluate** ethical implications of AI deployment
- **Create** comprehensive AI transformation strategies
