# Digital Transformation 2.0 with Generative AI

**SEIS 666** | University of St. Thomas | Spring 2026 | Instructor: Daniel Yarmoluk

---

*Master the technologies reshaping business, from LLMs to AI agents*

## Course Highlights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **10 Chapters** | From LLM architecture to AI governance and workforce transformation |
| **200 Concepts** | Interactive learning graph showing concept dependencies |
| **8 MicroSims** | Interactive simulations for hands-on exploration |
| **Bloom's Aligned** | Learning outcomes at all six cognitive levels |

## Why This Course Matters

Digital transformation has entered a fundamentally new phase. While foundational digital initiatives focused on cloud migration, automation, and data infrastructure, we are now witnessing an unprecedented acceleration driven by generative AI technologies.

!!! success "Research Shows"
    Organizations achieving digital maturity:

    - Deliver products and services at **twice the speed**
    - Reduce operational expenditures by **25-40%**
    - Realize significant gains in brand equity and customer satisfaction

However, fewer than one in four organizations successfully execute their digital transformation strategies. The differentiator? The ability to act with speed and intelligence, embedding AI-driven capabilities into the fabric of business operations.
