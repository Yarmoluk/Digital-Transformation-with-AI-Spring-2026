## Category Definitions

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts

Core concepts that establish the fundamentals of digital transformation and artificial intelligence. These are typically foundational prerequisites that many other concepts build upon.

**Examples:** Digital Transformation, Digitization, Digital Maturity, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning

### ARCH - LLM Architecture

Technical concepts related to the architecture, training, and operation of large language models. Understanding these concepts helps explain how LLMs work.

**Examples:** Transformer Architecture, Attention Mechanism, Pre-Training, Fine-Tuning, RLHF, Token, Context Window

### PLAT - AI Platforms

Specific AI platforms, products, and services from various providers. These concepts represent the commercial and open-source tools students will use.

**Examples:** OpenAI, GPT-4, ChatGPT, Anthropic, Claude, Google Gemini, Perplexity AI, Llama, Mistral

### PROMPT - Prompt Engineering

Techniques, strategies, and methods for effectively prompting large language models to achieve desired outputs.

**Examples:** Zero-Shot Prompting, Few-Shot Prompting, Chain-of-Thought, System Prompt, Output Formatting

### CUSTOM - Custom Solutions

Building custom AI solutions including custom GPTs, AI agents, and leveraging no-code/low-code platforms.

**Examples:** Custom GPT, GPT Builder, AI Agents, Autonomous Systems, No-Code AI Tools, RAG

### API - API Integration

Technical concepts for integrating with LLM APIs, including authentication, parameters, and optimization.

**Examples:** REST API, OpenAI API, API Authentication, Temperature Parameter, Rate Limiting

### MULTI - Multimodal AI

AI capabilities beyond text, including image generation, vision, audio, and video.

**Examples:** Text-to-Image, DALL-E, Midjourney, Diffusion Models, Vision Capabilities, Audio AI

### GOV - Governance

Organizational concepts for AI governance, strategy development, and establishing AI Centers of Excellence.

**Examples:** GAI Center of Excellence, AI Governance, AI Strategy, Change Management, Scaling AI

### ETHICS - Ethics

Responsible AI principles, bias mitigation, privacy, security, and regulatory compliance.

**Examples:** AI Bias, Bias Mitigation, Hallucination, Data Privacy, Responsible AI, Red-Teaming

### WORK - Workforce

Future of work concepts addressing how AI transforms jobs, skills, and organizational structures.

**Examples:** AI-Augmented Workforce, Skill Transformation, Role Evolution, Human-AI Collaboration

### BIZ - Business Applications

Practical business applications including use case identification, prioritization, and industry examples.

**Examples:** AI Use Case, Use Case Identification, ROI Estimation, Healthcare AI, Case Study Analysis

### ADV - Advanced Topics

Advanced and emerging topics including converging technologies and strategic transformation.

**Examples:** Converging Technologies, Edge AI, AI Infrastructure, AI Transformation, Capstone Project

## Taxonomy Distribution Target

To ensure balanced coverage, each category should ideally contain:

- Minimum: 10 concepts (~5%)
- Maximum: 35 concepts (~17.5%)
- Target average: ~17 concepts per category

Categories with significantly more or fewer concepts should be reviewed for potential splitting or merging.
